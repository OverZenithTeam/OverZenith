# 🌍 OverZenith – Bringing Space Closer to Everyone

Imagine exploring space from your own screen.
Our project is an **interactive, gamified web platform** that brings NASA’s knowledge closer to everyone.
You can **create your character, explore Earth from the Cupola view, unlock educational content, and level up through quizzes**.

With dynamic animations that evoke **weightlessness** and an **interactive 3D globe** full of discoveries, we make space exploration accessible to all — **turning it into a daily tool for curiosity, learning, and global connection.**
